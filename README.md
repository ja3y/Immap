Immap.py is a tool built to perform open source intelligence(OSINT) by pinpointing exact locations of coordinates extracted from geotagged images on google maps. This tool helps law enforcement or security professionals perform triage during investigation of a crime using geotagged images as evidence. This tool can help pinpoint last location of a missing person by means of last uploaded geotagged image.
